# RS3 Quest Helper (Alt1 app)

A step-by-step quest quick-guide overlay for RuneScape 3, built for the
[Alt1 Toolkit](https://runeapps.org/alt1) — Jagex's rule-compliant overlay
platform (no memory reading, no injection).

## Features

- **Every quest on the wiki**: the quest index is fetched live from the
  RuneScape Wiki (`Category:Quick guides`, ~370 quests, miniquests and
  events) and cached locally for 7 days
- **Search bar** to filter the quest list as you type
- **On-demand guides**: selecting a quest downloads its quick-guide wikitext
  from runescape.wiki and parses it into checkable steps — sections, item
  requirements, dialogue-option chips, notes, and location tables
- Click a step (or **Done, next**) to tick it off; the current step is
  highlighted; progress is saved per quest and shown in the quest list
- **Overlay** button paints the current step on top of the game screen
- **Map panel**: steps and location tables that carry coordinates on the wiki
  (`{{NPC map}}`/`{{Map}}` templates) get a green "Map x,y" chip that opens
  the RS3 world map (mejrs.github.io) **embedded inside the app**, centred on
  that exact spot with the right floor/plane and layer (e.g. Zanaris)
- Guides are cached locally (last 50) so revisiting a quest is instant
- **Assist mode** (Alt1 only, needs pixel + overlay permissions): captures
  the game screen ~1.5×/second and
  - **highlights the dialogue option to click** — when the current step has
    a "Chat:" entry and a dialogue box is open, the matching option gets a
    green box drawn around it in game (option text is OCR'd via the alt1
    DialogReader; falls back to the option number when wording differs)
  - **watches the chatbox** for quest-completion messages and marks the
    quest done automatically
  - shows a live status line in the app so you can see what it detected
- **Auto mode** (needs Assist): dialogue steps tick themselves — when the
  conversation for the current step has been on screen and then ends, the
  step is marked done automatically. Steps without dialogue (walking,
  combat, puzzles) remain manual — Alt1 has no access to game state, so
  there is no reliable generic signal for those.

## Running it

Alt1 loads apps over HTTP, so serve this folder with any static server:

```powershell
# from this folder — pick whichever you have installed:
python -m http.server 8090
# or
npx http-server -p 8090
```

Then install the app into Alt1 either way:

1. **Via link:** with Alt1 running, open this in a browser:
   `alt1://addapp/http://localhost:8090/appconfig.json`
2. **Via Alt1 browser:** open Alt1's built-in browser, navigate to
   `http://localhost:8090`, and click the "add to Alt1" banner at the top.

Accept the **overlay** permission when prompted so the on-screen step display
works. The app also runs in a normal browser for testing (overlay disabled).

Deep links are supported: `index.html?quest=Dragon+Slayer` opens a quest
directly.

## How the wiki parsing works

Quick guides on the wiki are wikitext built from a handful of templates
(`{{Checklist}}`, `{{Needed}}`, `{{Chat options}}`, wikitables for NPC
locations). `app.js` resolves these client-side via the wiki's CORS-enabled
API (`api.php?action=parse&prop=wikitext&origin=*`). Unknown templates are
dropped and links flattened to text, so the parser degrades gracefully on
unusual guides — and every guide links back to the full wiki page.

## Bonus addon: Tile Marker

A second, standalone Alt1 app in this folder (`tile.html` +
`appconfig-tile.json`): a tile-shaped diamond (or square/crosshair) that
follows your mouse over the game window, with size, colour, and line-width
controls. Install it separately:

```
alt1://addapp/http://localhost:8090/appconfig-tile.json
```

Needs the **pixel** (calibration), **gamestate** (mouse position) and
**overlay** permissions. **Calibrate from click marker**: click the ground
in game and the addon measures the game's yellow destination marker,
adopting its exact pixel size and aspect for the hover marker at your
current zoom/camera. Honest limitation: Alt1 cannot read the camera, so
the marker follows the cursor smoothly — it cannot snap to the real tile
grid the way renderer-hooking clients (Bolt/RuneLite-style) can.
